### 🎮 Game Mechanics Defined

```javascript
defaultGameConfig = {
    levelWidth: 3200,      // 2 screens wide
    levelHeight: 600,      
    platforms: 8-12,       // Random placement
    collectibles: 5-8,     // Victory condition
    enemies: 1-3,          // Moving obstacles
    gravity: 800,          // Adjustable
