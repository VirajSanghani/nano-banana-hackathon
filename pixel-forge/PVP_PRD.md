### Core Features

## Phase 1: MVP Arena Combat (P0)

### F1: Real-Time Weapon Generation
**Epic**: As a player, I want to create custom weapons during combat so I can adapt to any situation

#### User Stories:
```gherkin
Feature: Dynamic Weapon Creation
  Scenario: Player creates weapon during battle
    Given I am in combat with cooldown available
    When I type "flaming crossbow" in prompt window
    Then weapon generates in <3 seconds
    And weapon appears in my inventory slot
    And weapon has balanced damage/speed stats
    
  Scenario: Weapon cooldown management
    Given I just created a weapon
    When I try to create another weapon
    Then I see cooldown timer (10-15 seconds)
    And I can see preview of next weapon slot availability
```

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Weapon generation completes in <3 seconds
- Generated weapons maintain visual consistency with game art style
- Weapons automatically balanced via AI scoring system
- Maximum 20-word prompt length
- Cooldown prevents generation spam
