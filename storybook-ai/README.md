# Storybook AI - The Interactive Bedtime Story Generator

**Concept:** A magical web app that co-creates a unique, illustrated, and narrated bedtime story with a child. The child provides the initial ideas, and the AI brings the story to life with beautiful images, a gentle narrator's voice, and a custom musical score.

**User Experience (UX) Flow:**

1.  **The Spark of Imagination:** The app prompts the child with a friendly voice (from ElevenLabs): "Hello! What should our story be about tonight?" The child gives their ideas, e.g., "A little fox who wants to fly to the moon!"
2.  **Creating the World:** The app generates the first page of the story: a beautiful image of the little fox looking at the moon, with the first lines of the story written below. The narrator reads the text aloud.
3.  **The Interactive Choice:** At the end of the page, the narrator asks a question: "To fly to the moon, should the little fox try to build a rocket, or ask the wise old owl for help?"
4.  **The Story Unfolds:** The child chooses, and the app generates the next page of the story with a new image, text, and narration that reflects the choice.
5.  **The Soundtrack of Dreams:** Throughout the story, a gentle, procedurally generated musical score plays in the background, subtly changing its mood to match the story's events (e.g., becoming more wondrous as the fox gets closer to the moon).
6.  **The End:** After a few pages, the story concludes with a sweet, happy ending. The user can then save the entire story as a digital "storybook" (a sequence of images and audio files) to revisit later.

**Clear Implementation Path (The "How-To"):**

*   **Frontend:** A simple, full-screen web page that displays one image and the story text at a time. Buttons for the choices.
*   **Backend/Core Logic:**
    1.  **Story Generation:** Use a powerful language model (like the one accessible through Gemini's API) to generate the story text. The prompt would be something like: `"Write a short, interactive bedtime story for a 5-year-old about [child's idea]. At the end of each part, give the user two choices to continue the story."`
    2.  **Image Generation:** For each part of the story, send the text to the **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model with a prompt like: `"Generate a beautiful, whimsical illustration for a children's book based on this text: [story text]. The style should be soft and dreamlike."`
    3.  **Audio Narration:** Send the story text to the **ElevenLabs** API to generate the warm, gentle narrator's voice.
    4.  **Music Generation:** Use a simple, free API or a Python library (like `pyo` or `scamp`) to generate a continuous, looping, ambient musical score. The mood of the music can be changed by adjusting a few parameters (e.g., tempo, key) based on the story's content (e.g., "happy," "adventurous," "sleepy").
