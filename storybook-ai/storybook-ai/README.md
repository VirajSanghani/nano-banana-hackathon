## 🎭 Character Consistency Engine

The core innovation of Storybook AI is maintaining character consistency across story pages:

```typescript
// Builds consistent character profiles from child input
const character = consistencyEngine.buildCharacterProfile(childPrompt);

// Generates prompts that maintain visual consistency
const imagePrompt = consistencyEngine.buildPagePrompt(character, scene, pageNumber);
```

### Features:
- **Visual Anchors**: Key character traits that must appear in every image
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for Gemini's character consistency
- **Validation**: Ensures generated images match character profile

## 📊 Hackathon Demo Strategy
