## üß™ **Testing Scenarios**

### **1. First Time User Experience (Onboarding)**

**Expected Flow:**
1. **Welcome Screen** ‚Üí Animated intro with Sarah's story
2. **Demo Step** ‚Üí Shows how voice transforms to music
3. **Permission Step** ‚Üí Browser microphone permission request
4. **Calibration Step** ‚Üí Voice analysis and tuning
5. **First Creation** ‚Üí Guided first music creation
6. **Completion** ‚Üí Goal setting and celebration

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Open http://localhost:5173/ in a **fresh incognito window**
2. The app should start with the onboarding flow
3. Go through each step and test:
   - ‚úÖ Animations working smoothly
   - ‚úÖ "Continue" buttons appear when ready
   - ‚úÖ Step progress indicator updates
   - ‚úÖ Can navigate back/forward
   - ‚úÖ Microphone permission works in Permission Step
   - ‚úÖ Audio visualization appears in Calibration Step

### **2. Main Application Features**

**After Onboarding Completion:**
1. **Audio Processing Panel** (Left side)
   - Should show "Audio Processing: Active"
   - Volume, Clarity, Frequency, Intensity meters
   - Green indicators when working

2. **Emotion Detection Panel** (Right side)
   - Should show "Emotion Detection: Analyzing"
   - Detects emotions when you speak
   - Shows confidence percentages
   - Displays secondary emotions

3. **Background Visualization**
   - Particle system responds to voice
   - Colors change based on detected emotions
   - Particles react to audio levels

**Testing Instructions:**
1. **Speak into microphone**: Try different emotions:
   - Say "I'm so excited about this!" (should detect excitement/joy)
   - Say "I feel calm and peaceful" (should detect calm)
   - Say "This is incredible!" (should detect surprise/excitement)

2. **Check Audio Levels**:
   - Volume meter should respond to voice
   - Clarity should show good percentages
   - Emotional intensity should change

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Particles should move more when speaking
   - Colors should shift based on detected emotion
   - Background should be visually appealing

### **3. Error Handling & Edge Cases**

**Microphone Issues:**
1. **Deny microphone permission** ‚Üí Should show helpful error message
2. **No microphone available** ‚Üí Should gracefully degrade
3. **Microphone in use** ‚Üí Should provide retry options

**Browser Compatibility:**
- **Chrome**: Full functionality expected
- **Firefox**: Should work with minor differences
- **Safari**: May have some audio processing limitations
- **Edge**: Should work similar to Chrome

**Mobile Testing:**
- Touch interactions should work
- Responsive design should adapt
- Audio might have limitations on mobile

---

### **4. Development Features**

**Debug Panel** (Development Only):
1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+D** to toggle debug panel
2. Should show:
   - App state information
   - Real-time audio data
   - Emotion detection results
   - Performance metrics

**Console Output:**
- Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console
- Should see: "üéµ Vibe-Synth starting in development mode"
- No critical errors should appear

---

## üêõ **Known Limitations (Before API Integration)**

### **Expected "Simulated" Behaviors:**
1. **Music Generation**: Currently shows placeholder
   - Click "Start Creating Music" ‚Üí Shows "Coming soon" notification
   - This is normal - waiting for API integration

2. **Emotion Detection**: Uses pattern matching
   - Works with voice characteristics and keywords
   - Will be enhanced with real AI APIs

3. **Visual Generation**: Particle system only
   - No actual image generation yet
   - Placeholder for future Gemini integration

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**1. "Microphone not working"**
```
Solution: 
- Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
- Ensure microphone not used by other apps
- Try refreshing the page
- Check system audio settings
```

**2. "Particles not moving"**
```
Solution:
- Speak louder into microphone
- Check audio processing panel shows activity
- Verify microphone permission granted
- Try different browser if needed
```

**3. "Onboarding stuck on step"**
```
Solution:
- Wait for animations to complete (each step has timing)
- Check browser console for errors
- Try refreshing and starting over
- Use debug panel (Ctrl+Shift+D) to check state
```

**4. "App not loading"**
```
Solution:
- Verify server running on http://localhost:5173/
- Check terminal for error messages
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
```
